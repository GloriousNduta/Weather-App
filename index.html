        <strong>Vanilla </strong> is frequently used to flavor ice cream,
        especially in North America, Asia, and Europe. Vanilla ice cream, like
        other flavors of ice cream, was originally created by cooling a mixture
        made of cream, sugar, and vanilla above a container of ice and salt. The
        type of vanilla used to flavor ice cream varies by location. In North
        America and Europe consumers are interested in a more prominent, smoky
        flavor, while in Ireland, a more anise-like flavor is desired. To create
        the smooth consistency of ice cream, the mixture has to be stirred
        occasionally and then returned to the container of ice and salt to
        continue the solidification process. According to Iced: 180 Very Cool
        Concoctions, many people often consider vanilla to be the
        <span class="terms">"default" or "plain"</span> flavor of ice cream.
